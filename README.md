Developed a 2D game framework using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, enabling the creation of dynamic game worlds.
Built core components such as game objects, a hierarchical scene graph, a camera system, and a game loop for smooth gameplay.
Implemented key features like grid-based object placement, sprite rendering, and inventory management.
Designed modular classes for extensibility, including `GameObject`, `Sprite`, `Input`, and `Camera`, ensuring reusability.
Optimized rendering pipeline with camera offset logic and delta-time updates for consistent performance.
